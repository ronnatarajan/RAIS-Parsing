# RAIS-Parsing

## Efficiency folder
This folder contains code snippets that could be used to evaluate the efficiency of a program (as in big O analysis)

## Robustness
In an attempt to evaluate code quality, this folder contains scripts to evaluate robustness. This is done by walking throught the given file and counting the number of try-catch blocks as well as errors and error messages.

## Testing
This folder has functions that try to find the testing cases and dataset from a github repo. The code is not complete yet.

## Other files
These files would be useful in general to analyze python files. I have scripts to evaluate code quality and comments as well as count the number of classes, functions, and dependencies.
